Each part of this guide is designed to be able to be used independently from the other parts, so anyone can start at the part that applies to their situation. As a result, software may be listed multiple times in different "What you need" sections. You do not need to download software multiple times.

This guide is split into two major categories: New 3DS and Old 3DS / 2DS.

The New 3DS is a more complicated device to perform this installation on, since it was never designed to run 2.1.0, which we need to downgrade to as part of the process (see [OTP Info](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/OTP-Info) for why).

The Old 3DS and 2DS are extremely similar devices internally. The only major difference that matters for this guide is that, although you are never instructed to do this, you must never perform a system format on a 2DS while it is below firmware version 6.0.0, or you will be unable to complete the initial setup and will be stuck.

*The following applies to all devices:*

If your version is below 9.0.0, you can follow the link below to be brought to a page that will walk you through the process of updating directly to 9.2.0.

If your version is between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0, you can follow the correct link to go through the guide, but you can skip "Part 2 - Downgrading" (go straight from Part 1 to Part 3) as you are already one the correct version.

If your version is between 9.3.0 and 10.3.0, you can follow the correct link and go through the guide with no changes.

If your version is between 10.4.0 and 10.6.0, you can follow the correct link to be brought to a page that will walk you through the process of hardmodding your console in order to downgrade your NATIVE_FIRM to 10.2.0. After that, you can proceed as if your version were 10.2.0.

If you already have a CFW setup, change menuhax to type 2 and set your menuhax trigger to dpad down, then start the guide at Part 4.
