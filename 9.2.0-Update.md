Most 3DS CFW applications and software are designed for use with a SysNAND version between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0. If you are below version 9.0.0, you will need to use this guide to update your 3DS without going all the way to the latest version.    

If you have a system at any version above 9.2.0 with a browser version below -20 (such as 10.3.0-**15U**) because you used a cart update *([cart updates](https://3dbrew.org/wiki/Home_Menu#System_Versions) do not update the browser, leaving you unable to use browserhax which only supports 9.0.0-20 and above, where the -20 indicates browser version and 9.0.0 indicates system version; both of these must be above the minimum to use browserhax)*, you can also follow this guide.     
You will need to copy the contents of the [starter kit](https://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip) to your SD card, then substitute the sysUpdater CIA install step to install [the Homebrew Launcher CIA](https://github.com/yellows8/hblauncher_loader/releases) instead, which you can then use to launch [this](https://mega.nz/#!10FjBKrB!PqbqJ8oSzoX-6iuhafR7kdHiWUBQSptrhjYTR6BLLUI) ([mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzPfvjeuhqoDcHV0V1VHalF4NDQ/view?usp=sharing)) version of sysUpdater copied (both files) to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card and launch it with the Homebrew Launcher icon on your system. You then must press Y to downgrade to 9.2.0 instead of A to update.

If you are on versions 9.0.0 through 10.6.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Get-Started).

If you already have an EmuNAND setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND.

**This section of the guide will most likely not work from a version <4.0.0, use a game cart update that [contains a version](http://www.3dsdb.com/) 4.0.0 or above.**

11. Go to SysNAND File Options, then select the Dump Health & Safety option
12. Press Select to eject your SD card, then put it in your computer

19. Go to the SysNAND file options menu on the main menu
29. Backup SysNAND to `sysNAND.bin`
7. Press Select on the main menu to eject your SD card
8. Put your SD card in your computer, then rename `sysNAND.bin` and `emuNAND.bin` *(If you have one)* to `sysNAND-OLD.bin` and `emuNAND-OLD.bin` *(If you have one)*
9. Copy over `sysNAND-OLD.bin` and `emuNAND-OLD.bin` *(If you have one)* to a safe folder on your computer in case you ever want to revert to this version

Now go to the `dbs` folder and create two empty files called `title.db` and `import.db` in this folder. Insert your SD card back into your 3DS then go to Settings > 3DS > Software. The system will tell you the database needs to be rebuilt. Allow it to do this, then redo steps 9 through 17.
28. Press the home button to go to the home menu, then open the sysUpdater application and press the A button to install
