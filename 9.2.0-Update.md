Most 3DS CFW applications and software are designed for use with a sysNAND version between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0. If you are below version 9.0.0, you will need to use this guide to update your 3DS without going all the way to the latest version.    

If you are on 10.4.0, 10.5.0, or 10.6.0, then you must follow [this](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Hardmod) guide instead to downgrade using a hardmod.    
  
If you are between 9.0.0 and 10.3.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Get-Started).
