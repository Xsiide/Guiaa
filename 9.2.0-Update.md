Most 3DS CFW applications and software are designed for use with a sysNAND version between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0. If you are below version 9.0.0, you will need to use this guide to update your 3DS without going all the way to the latest version.    

If you are on 10.4.0, 10.5.0, or 10.6.0, then you must follow [this](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Hardmod) guide instead to downgrade using a hardmod.    
  
If you are between 9.0.0 and 10.3.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Get-Started).

If you already have an emuNAND setup, this guide deals exclusively with sysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to sysNAND.

#### Instructions

1. If you have installed MenuHax or ThemeHax before, you should remove them by changing the theme to anything else.
2. Copy `rxTools.dat` from the rxTools zip to the root of your SD card
3. Copy the `fbi_inject.app` file from the `fbi_injection/your_region` folder in the rxTools zip to the root of your SD card
4. Copy `firmware.bin` from the rx2.5.2Firmware zip to the root of your SD card
5. Delete the `updates` folder from your SD card if there is one. If not, move to the next step
6. Copy the `updates` folder from the 9.2.0 firmware zip to the root of your SD card
7. Copy sysUpdater.cia from the sysUpdater zip to the root of your SD card
8. Eject your SD card and put it back in your 3DS
9. Power it on, then open the browser and go to `http://launch.rxtools.net/rxTools`
10. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into rxTools and it will prompt you to press the R button, which you should do
11. Let it install any files it needs to
12. Go to `Other Options` and select it with the A button
13. Select `Install FBI` to replace the Health and Safety app with a CIA manager
14. Go back, then select Option 6, `DevMenu`
15. Your 3DS will reboot back into the home menu
16. Launch the Health and Safety Application
17. Navigate to `sysUpdater.cia` and press A to install
18. If you get a database error, it is because you have never accessed the eShop before. To fix this, you will need to insert your SD card into your computer, then open the `Nintendo 3DS` folder. From here you will need to go into the first ID folder, then the second ID folder. The IDs will have random looking names. Now go to the `dbs` folder and create two empty files called `title.db` and `import.db` in this folder. Insert your SD card back into your 3DS then go to Settings > 3DS > Software. The system will tell you the database needs to be rebuilt. Allow it to do this, then redo steps 9 through 17.
19. Open the sysUpdater application and press the A button to update to 9.2.0.
