Most 3DS CFW applications and software are designed for use with a sysNAND version between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0. If you are below version 9.0.0, you will need to use this guide to update your 3DS without going all the way to the latest version.    

If you are on 10.4.0, 10.5.0, or 10.6.0, then you must follow [this](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Hardmod) guide instead to downgrade using a hardmod.    
  
If you are between 9.0.0 and 10.3.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/plailect.github.io/wiki/Get-Started).

#### Instructions

1. Extract the rxTools zip to a folder of your choice
2. Enter the `tools` directory
3. Download the appropriate decrypted 10.4.0/10.5.0/10.6.0 NATIVE-FIRM and the decrypted 10.2.0 NATIVE-FIRM as CIA files
4. Rename the 10.4 NATIVE_FIRM file to `firmoriginal.cia` then put it in the autofirm folder
5. Rename the 10.2 NATIVE_FIRM file to `firmnuevo.cia` then put it in the autofirm folder
6. Place the `msvcr120d.dll` file in the autofirm folder
7. Run "start.bat"
8. If everything worked, then you will have a modified `nand.bin` containing the 10.2.0 NATIVE_FIRM on version 10.4.0, 10.5.0, or 10.6.0
9. Flash this `nand.bin`, you can now follow the rest of the guide as if you were on 10.3.0 or below.
