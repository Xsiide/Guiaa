Most 3DS CFW applications and software are designed for use with a SysNAND version between 9.0.0 and 9.2.0. If you are below version 9.0.0, you will need to use this guide to update your 3DS without going all the way to the latest version.    

If you are on versions 9.0.0 through 10.7.0 you can just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Get-Started).

Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

This section of the guide is just a part of the larger [9.2.0 Update](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/9.2.0-Update) section.

This will get your console unique OTP (only available on versions <3.0.0), meaning that you can do this, then update to 9.2.0 with one of the other methods in the 1.0.0 section of the chart, then do Part 5 - arm9loaderhax *(when you get to Part 5, you should skip Section IV and Section V, then update to the latest system version after completing Section VI)*.

#### What you need

* The latest release of [OTPHelper](https://github.com/d0k3/OTPHelper/releases/)

#### Instructions
1. Copy `arm11.bin` and `arm9.bin` from the OTPHelper zip to the root of your SD card
1. Go to http://dukesrg.github.io/2xrsa.html?arm11.bin on your 3DS
2. OTPHelper will launch, then select the "Dump otp.bin (0x100)" option
3. Press Select on the main menu to eject your SD card
4. Put your SD card in your computer, then copy over `otp.bin` to a safe folder on your computer.
5. Ensure that `otp.bin` is 256 bytes
6. Backup `otp.bin` to multiple locations (such as online file storage)

You can now do the following **in order**:
+ Update to 9.2.0 with one of the methods in the relevant section of the 9.2.0 Update chart [here](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/9.2.0-Update) 
+ Do [Part 5 - arm9loaderhax](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Part-5-(arm9loaderhax)) 
    + Skip steps related to "emergency files"
    + Skip steps related to "RedNAND"
    + Skip Section IV and Section V, then update to the latest system version after completing Section VI)*.
