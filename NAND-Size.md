A valid NAND backup should be one of the following sizes in most situations.

Occasionally, you will get a backup with a different size than one of these listed. It is fine for a backup to be larger than expected, just ensure that it is never *smaller* than the sizes listed.

**Your backup should match one of the sizes on this page; if it does not, you should delete it and make a new one!**

The brand name refers to the manufacturer of the NAND chip in your device, **not** your SD card.
