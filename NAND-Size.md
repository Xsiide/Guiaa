A valid NAND backup should be one of the following sizes.    

**Your backup should match one of the sizes on this page; if it does not, you should delete it and make a new one!**

The brand name refers to the manufacturer of the *internal* NAND chip in your device, **not** your SD card.

*Note that DSiWare and anything else that is installed to NAND instead of the SD card may slightly increase the size of your backups.*
