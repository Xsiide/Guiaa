This is a method of resuming the 2.1.0 downgrade after repeated sysUpdater failure on 0004003000008F02.cia

#### What you need

* [rxTools 2.5.2](https://github.com/roxas75/rxTools/releases/download/2.5.2/release.rar) ([Mirror](http://rxtools.net/php/downloads.php?dl=rxTools%20v2.5.2))  

#### Instructions

2. Copy `rxTools.dat` from the rxTools zip to the root of your SD card
3. Go to `/Nintendo 3DS/<EmuNAND_id0>/<EmuNAND_id1>/extdata/`; if you followed the guide, this will be the <id0> folder *without* `SysNAND.txt` or `EmuNAND.txt` in it
4. Delete `00000082` for JPN region, `0000008f` for USA region, or `00000098` for EUR region
8. Eject your SD card and put it back in your 3DS
19. Open the browser on SysNAND, then go to `http://dukesrg.no-ip.org/3ds/go/?rxTools.dat` or `http://www.reboot.ms/3ds/load.html?rxTools.dat`
20. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into rxTools and it will prompt you to press the R button, which you should do
21. Let it install any files it needs to
22. Boot rxMode EmuNAND
24. Your 3DS will reboot back into the home menu
28. Open the sysUpdater application and press the Y button to downgrade

If this allowed you to complete the downgrade successfully, you can now pickup the guide from where you left off
