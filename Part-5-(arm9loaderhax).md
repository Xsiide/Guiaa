**You cannot use another console's OTP or you will brick GUARANTEED.**

This guide will provide you with two options for using Custom Firmware on SysNAND via arm9loaderhax, Luma3DS and CakesFW.

Luma3DS is a more feature rich CFW in addition to being more noob friendly, and is recommended for beginners, while CakesFW is a more complex CFW that is recommended only for advanced users. Otherwise, they perform a similar function and you can use either according to personal preferences.

Currently, Luma3DS supports Region Free patches, which enable users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps, and AGB_FIRM/TWL_FIRM patches, which enable users to use installed GBA games and DSi homebrew without manually patching files.

**If you currently have Updated SysNAND and want to switch to a different CFW, each link contains instructions for switching to it from the other.**
