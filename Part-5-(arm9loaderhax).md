This guide will provide you with two options for using Custom Firmware on SysNAND via arm9loaderhax, AuReiNAND and CakesFW.

AuReiNAND is a simpler CFW with less options and is more noob friendly, and is recommended for beginners, while CakesFW is a more complex CFW that will include features such as AGB_FIRM patching and arm9 hooks in the future, but is recommended for advanced users. They other wise perform a very similar function and you can use either.

Currently, AuReiNAND supports Region Free patches, which enable users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps.

**If you followed an old version of this guide that did not include Updated SysNAND and want to switch to Updated SysNAND + AuReiNAND, just restore your SysNAND from a pre-arm9loaderhax SysNAND backup *(such as `sysNAND_original.bin`)* using Decrypt9 and follow all of one of these Parts.**

**If you currently have Updated SysNAND and want to switch to a different CFW, each link contains instructions for switching to it from the other.**
