This guide will provide you with two options for using Custom Firmware on SysNAND via arm9loaderhax, AuReiNAND and CakesFW.

AuReiNAND is a simpler CFW with less options and is more noob friendly, and is recommended for beginners, while CakesFW is a more complex CFW that will include features such as AGB_FIRM patching and arm9 hooks in the future, and is recommended for advanced users. They other wise perform a very similar function and you can use either.
